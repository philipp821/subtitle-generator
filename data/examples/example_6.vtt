Now as I was saying, there's a beautiful parcel available right down here by

1
00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:06.100 line:100%
the flats.

2
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.600 line:100%
I appreciate the offer, but I have some matters to look after.

3
00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:12.100 line:100%
Well, I'm confused.

4
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.500 line:100%
I thought you had completed your mission,

5
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.320 line:100%
but you're still running around here with the same little critter.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.280 line:100%
It's complicated.

He returned to me.

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.820 line:100%
I removed my helmet, and now I'm an apostate.

10
00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:34.340 line:100%
Which is all the more reason for you to stay here with us.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:41.100 line:100%
Where you're from, you may be an apostate, but here you'd be landed gentry.
